# Chicken Breast Sandwich

## Ingredients

For each 

- 3 leaves of lettuce
- 50g of Cucumber
- 50g of Tomato or Cherry Tomato
- 20g of Cheese, ideally cottage.
- 100g Chicken breast
- 1 egg
- Salt
- Condiments (optional)

## Preparation

1.  For each sandwich, carefully remove three large lettuce leaves from the stem to use as your wrap. This will provide a sturdy base for your fillings and add an extra dose of nutrients to your meal. 
2. Separate and inspect the leaves and discard any that are torn or bruised. Then, rinse the chosen leaves thoroughly in running water, being sure to submerge them for at least three minutes in cool water and white vinegar. Finally, rinse the leaves once again with fresh running water.

    It's also important to remember to start with clean hands, especially if you're cooking for others. Wash your hands well with cold water before handling any food to avoid accidentally compromising the principle of nonviolence. Taking these steps will not only ensure that your greens are clean and safe to eat, but also promote a healthy and hygienic kitchen environment.
3. I suggest slicing a moderate amount of cucumber and tomato according to your personal preference. It's important to exercise portion control and aim for no more than what you actually need of each to avoid overconsumption.

4. Using your hands, shred the chicken breast into small pieces. Next, heat a pan on medium-high heat and add a small amount of water and a pinch of salt. Once the water begins to simmer, add the shredded chicken breast to the pan and stir-fry for a short time, just until the chicken is heated through and slightly browned. Be sure to keep an eye on the chicken to avoid overcooking or burning. Using water instead of oil for the stir-fry helps to reduce unnecessary calories and fat.

5. Fry the egg. When frying an egg, it's important to aim for a half-cooked consistency rather than fully cooking the egg through. This is because overcooking eggs can destroy some of the important nutrients and proteins present in the egg, making it less nutritious overall. Drink your eggs raw, eat your eggs partially cooked.

## Presentation

1. Use the lettuce to replace the bread.
2. Top the ingredients one by one.
3. Add condiments. My personal recommendations are spicy condiments such as *Peperoncino*.
4. Close the sandwich.
5. Eat it fresh. If saving it for later is a necessity make sure to storage it in a cold place such as a refrigerator or a cooler bag.
