# Expectation and Unpredictability

An **expectation** is a weighted average of some measure associated with a random variable.

A **random variable** is a measure of a trait or value associated with an object, a person or a place - something in the real world - that is unpredictable.

For an inference to be valid, you must select your sample carefully so that you get a true representation of the population. Even if your sample is representative, the numbers in the sample dataset will always exhibit some noise — random variation, in other words — that guarantees the sample statistic is not exactly identical to its corresponding population statistic.

**Descriptive statistics** describe the characteristics of your numerical dataset, while **inferential statistics** are used to make inferences from subsets of data so you can better understand the larger datasets from which the subset is taken.

In statistics, this smaller data selection is known as a **sample**, and the larger, complete dataset from which the sample is taken is called the **population**.

A **data scientist** is someone who has substantive knowledge of one or several fields and uses statistics, math, coding, and strong communication skills to help her tease out, understand, and communicate data insights that lie within raw datasets related to her field of expertise.
