# Deceive RPG

ver: 0.1 (Beta Playtest)

## Character Concept

In the Deceive RPG game, character creation revolves around choosing an occupation based on a specific talent or skill set, rather than pre-defined packages. To accommodate the wide range of possible character concepts, the game encourages players and the game master to collaboratively determine the character's occupational bonus, which grants a "buy one - take two" bonus in related abilities. This approach allows for greater flexibility and customization in character creation.

### Ultimate High School Students 

In Deceive RPG game, each player creates a character who is an Ultimate High School student with a unique talent or skill. The specific talent or skill is left up to the player to determine, and can range from traditional academic pursuits like Ultimate Literature or Ultimate Mathematics, to more unconventional talents like Ultimate Cosplayer or Ultimate Pop Idol.

The character's talent or skill serves as their occupational bonus, granting them a significant advantage in related abilities. For example, an Ultimate Hacker would have a bonus in mathematic-related skills such as Mathematical Logic and Hyper Focus, while an Ultimate Detective would have a bonus in Detecting Lies and Reconstructive Imagination.

Overall, the Ultimate High School concept requires that GMs and players must balance their unique talents with the challenges of the game's plot, mechanics and natural logic.

#### Talent

In addition to the occupational bonus, being an Ultimate in Deceive RPG also grants the character a Talent that relates to their capability of killing. This Talent is an added layer of complexity and intrigue to the game, as players must balance their unique abilities and tendencies with the challenge of not being the one identified as the culprit when a murder occurs.

For instance, the Ultimate High School Hacker might have the Talent "Firewall Breaker", which allows them to gain access to security systems and devices in the game's setting. Meanwhile, the Ultimate High School Cosplayer might possess the Talent "Master of Disguise", enabling them to flawlessly impersonate other characters in the game.

These Talents provide a unique twist on the traditional RPG mechanic of abilities, allowing players to utilize their skills in creative and unexpected ways. However, they also add a layer of risk, as players must carefully consider how to utilize their Talents without drawing suspicion or being identified as the culprit in a murder investigation.

## Abilities

### Investigative Abilities

Investigative abilities are treated differently than traditional skills, as they are considered essential to the game's mechanics and are always assumed to succeed when applied to the correct situation. This means that players do not need to roll dice to use their investigative abilities; instead, they simply inform the game master of their character's action, and the game master provides the relevant information. The goal of this approach is to allow players to focus on their characters' investigative abilities and the story's unfolding events, rather than being bogged down by failed rolls or uncertainty about what information they may be missing.

#### Analytical Abilities

##### Bayesian Probability

Bayesian probability is a statistical method that allows one to update their beliefs about an event based on new evidence. In Deceive RGP, a character with the ability to use Bayesian probability would be able to make more informed and accurate judgments about the likelihood of certain events or hypotheses based on the available evidence.

##### Mathematical Logic

Mathematical logic is the study of mathematical reasoning and the rules of logical inference. In Deceive RGP, a character with the ability to use mathematical logic would be able to analyze and interpret complex patterns of evidence to make more informed and accurate deductions.

##### Encyclopedic Knowledge

Encyclopedic Knowledge is the ability to retain and recall a vast amount of information on a wide range of subjects [^1]. In Deceive RGP, a character with Encyclopedic Knowledge would be able to draw on their vast store of knowledge to make connections between seemingly unrelated pieces of evidence or to identify obscure references in witness testimony.

##### Elocutio

Elocutio, also known as the art of speaking or rhetoric, is the ability to effectively communicate ideas and persuade others through language. In Deceive RGP, a character with Elocutio would be able to use their mastery of language to gather information from witnesses, negotiate with suspects, and convince others to see things from their perspective.

##### Mood Analysis

Mood Analysis is the ability to analyze a character for signs of despair and hope in a character, which could provide clues about the motivations or future actions of the analyzed character. In Deceive RGP, a character with the ability to use Mood Analysis would be able to read the emotional state of suspects after an interaction.

##### Detecting Lies

Detecting Lies is the ability to accurately determine when someone is lying, based on subtle cues in their body language, tone of voice, or word choice. In Deceive RGP, a character with the ability to use Detecting Lies would be able to identify inconsistencies or discrepancies in the statements of suspects and witnesses.

##### Photographic Memory

Photographic Memory is the ability to vividly recall information from one's memory, often including details such as images, sounds, and text. In Deceive RGP, a character with Photographic Memory would be able to recall precise details about crime scenes, evidence, and witness testimony, often long after they were initially observed.

##### Play the Actor

Play the Actor is the ability to convincingly lie and deceive others through acting and improvisation. Deceive RGP, a character with Play the Actor would be able to convincingly deceive others, making it difficult for other characters to detect their lies or uncover the truth.

##### Reconstructive Imagination

Reconstructive Imagination is the ability to use imagination and intuition to fill in missing pieces of information and recreate past events in one's mind. In Deceive RGP, a character with Reconstructive Imagination would be able to use their creativity and perceptiveness to visualize events that they did not witness firsthand, providing valuable insight into mysteries and investigations.

##### Hyper-Focus

Hyper-Focus is the ability to concentrate intensely on a single task or subject, often to the point of excluding distractions and ignoring other important information. In Deceive RGP, a character with Hyper-Focus would be able to zero in on specific details and clues, allowing them to gain a deeper understanding of the mysteries they are exploring.

##### Absolute Gut-Feeling

Absolute Gut-Feeling is the ability to sense or intuitively know the correct answer or course of action, even without a clear or logical explanation. In Deceive RGP, a character with Absolute Gut-Feeling would be able to make seemingly impossible connections and deductions, drawing on their intuition and instincts to guide them to the truth.

##### Forensic Analysis

Forensic Analysis is the application of scientific methods and techniques to the investigation of crimes and other legal issues. In Deceive RGP, a character with the ability to perform Forensic Analysis would be able to use their knowledge of scientific principles and procedures to analyze physical evidence and reconstruct the events surrounding a crime.

##### Stalking Skills

Stalking Skills refer to the ability to observe and monitor a person, often with the goal of gathering information. In Deceive RGP, a character with strong Surveillance Skills would be able to gather information by observing the character being stalked, monitoring their movements and interactions, and identifying patterns of behavior.

##### Metacognition

Metacognition is the ability to reflect on one's own thinking processes and to consciously regulate and direct one's own learning and problem-solving strategies. In Deceive RGP, a character with strong metacognitive skills would be able to analyze and improve their own thinking and problem-solving abilities, enabling them to become more effective investigators and problem-solvers.

#### Emotional Abilities

##### Charm

Charm is the ability to interact with others in a likable, appealing, and engaging way. In Deceive RGP, a character with strong charm skills would be able to use their personal magnetism to win over others, making them more willing to cooperate, divulge information, or even become allies.

##### Intimidation

Intimidation is the ability to instill fear or apprehension in others through forceful and threatening behavior. In Deceive RGP, a character with strong intimidation skills would be able to use their intimidating presence and actions to elicit information or coerce cooperation from others.

##### Reassurance

Reassurance is the ability to comfort and encourage others, providing emotional support and easing their anxieties or fears. In Deceive RGP, a character with strong reassurance skills would be able to build relationships with other characters and gain their trust, making it more likely that they will cooperate and provide valuable information.

##### Self-Control

Self control is the ability to regulate one's thoughts, emotions, and behaviors in order to achieve long-term goals or to maintain composure in stressful or challenging situations. In Deceive RGP, a character with high levels of self control would be able to maintain a clear and focused mind even in the midst of chaos or danger, enabling them to make rational and effective decisions.

##### Despair Absorption

Despair absorption is a unique ability that allows a character to absorb de Despair of another character. In Deceive RGP, a character with the ability to absorb Despair will be known by the group as a source of hope.

##### Despair Projection

Despair absorption is a unique ability that allows a character to manifest Despair on another character. In Deceive RGP, a character with the ability to project Despair will be known by the group as a source of Despair. However, projecting Despair might make your character be viewed by the negative emotions they are projecting, potentially leading to a bad image overall.

##### Authority

Authority is the ability to project a sense of confidence, leadership, and control in a given situation. In Deceive RGP, a character with authority could have a significant impact on the actions and decisions of other characters in the game.This ability could also be useful in navigating social situations or negotiations with other characters. By projecting an air of confidence and control, the character with authority could potentially gain an advantage in convincing others to see things from their perspective or to agree to their terms[^3].

#### Cohabitational Abilities

##### Collaboration

Collaboration is the ability to work effectively with others towards a shared goal. In Deceive RGP, a character with this ability would be able to contribute to group tasks and investigations by building strong working relationships with other characters, communicating effectively, and using their unique strengths to complement those of their allies.

Characters with points in this can burn *n* amount of the points they have in this skill to the actions of other characters if they are actively helping them.

##### Friendly

Being friendly is the ability to establish positive relationships with others and create a welcoming and supportive environment. In Deceive RGP, a character with this ability would be able to make friends and allies more easily, building strong and positive relationships with other characters[^4].

##### Conflict Resolution

Conflict resolution is the ability to manage and resolve conflicts between individuals or groups. In Deceive RGP, a character with the ability to resolve conflicts could play a vital role in maintaining order and preventing further harm in the wake of a tragedy.

### General Abilities

General abilities in Deceive RPG are a set of skills that are used in a variety of non-investigative situations in the game. These abilities cover a broad range of skills, such as combat, athletics, social interactions, and technical skills. Unlike investigative abilities, players in Deceive RPG are required to roll dice when using general abilities, as their success is not assumed. Depending on the game, different general abilities may be more or less important to a character's success, but overall they are designed to add richness and depth to a character's abilities beyond their investigative skills.

In Deceive RPG, characters have an initial pool of points to allocate across their general abilities, and can use these points to improve their chances of success when performing actions related to those abilities by burning a point. As characters die and the game progresses, every survivor will receive additional points to allocate towards their general abilities, which can make them more effective in non-investigative situations.

##### Athletics

Athletics allows you to perform general acts of physical derring-do, from running to jumping to dodging falling or oncoming objects. Any physical action not covered by another ability, probably falls under the rubric of Athletics.

If your Athletics rating is 8 or more, your Hit Threshold, the Target Number your opponents use when attempting to hit you in combat, is 4. Otherwise, your Hit Threshold is 3.

##### Burglary

You’re good at placing yourself inside places you have no right to be, and you’re good at taking things once you’re there. With a successful Burglary test, you can:

-   pick pockets
-   unobtrusively search a target’s pockets
-   plant objects on unsuspecting subjects
-   pick locks
-   deactivate or evade security systems (although particularly high-tech security systems might require you to have a point in the Investigative ability Hacking)
-   find suitable places for forced entry, and use them

Many locks require specialized tools that can be produced with a Preparedness test; such tools range from simple lock picks to sonic high-tech multi-tools. Complex or tricky locks may have a higher than usual Difficulty to open them speedily, to avoid noise or damage, or to relock afterward.

##### Business Affairs

You know how to run a profitable business, group, organization, cult, secret society and etc.

##### Conceal

You can hide things from view and conceal them from search. Your methods might include camouflage, holding items out on your person, snaking things into drawers unobserved, building secret compartments, or even altering a thing’s visual signature with paint or plaster.

This ability also allows you to discover things intentionally concealed.

##### Disguise

This is the skill of altering your own appearance, posture, and voice to be unrecognizable. Disguising others in anything more complex than a baseball cap or false mustache is good only for brief periods, as posture and body language are vital components in any successful disguise.

This ability also covers selling yourself as a different person: vocal mannerisms, altered body language, dress and motion sense, and realistic-seeming reactions.

Successfully disguising yourself as an actual person already known to those you’re interacting with is extraordinarily difficult. Brief voice-only mimicry pits you against a Difficulty of 4. Face-to-face impersonation requires a successful roll against a Difficulty of 7 for every five minutes of sustained contact between you and the object of your impersonation.

##### Explosives

You’re an expert in bombs and booby-traps. You can:

-   defuse bombs and traps
-   handle nitroglycerine or other dangerously unstable materials with relative safety
-   given time, blow open safes or vaults without damaging the contents
-   mix explosive compounds from common chemicals
-   safely construct and detonate explosive devices or booby-traps of your own

Explosives doubles as an investigative ability when used to:

-   reconstruct exploded bombs
-   for any bomb (exploded or unexploded), determine the method and materials of the bomb-maker, and deduce his sophistication, background, and skill

##### Filch

Your nimble fingers allow you to unobtrusively manipulate small objects. You can:

-   pilfer clues from a crime scene under the very noses of unsuspecting authorities
-   pick pockets
-   plant objects on unsuspecting subjects

##### Fleeing

Although you are not a strong overall athlete, you can boot it like a bat out of hell when chased by dangerous people, beings, or moving objects.

If your Fleeing rating is more than twice your final Athletics rating, you can buy rating points in Fleeing above the value at a reduced rate, getting 2 rating points for each build point spent. Hence, if your Athletics rating is 0, all your Fleeing is half-price.

##### Gambling

You are conversant with the rules and etiquette of all forms of gambling, from Texas hold ‘em and roulette to horse racing and numbers rackets. To win (or strategically lose) at a game of chance or sporting flutter requires a Gambling test, or a contest if played against an NPC with the Gambling ability. In addition to playing by the rules and winning, you can:

-   spot cheating, either by the house or by another player
-   stack a deck, rig a horse race, load dice, or otherwise cheat

Palming cards, tiles, or dice is allowed as a Gambling test; anything else requires Conceal or Filch.

Gambling doubles as an **Investigative** ability when used to:

-   calculate the odds of events ruled by probabilities
-   use Bullshit Detector on professional gamblers despite their poker faces
-   interact with gamblers and blend in at casinos

##### Health

Health measures your ability to sustain injuries, resist infection, and survive the effects of toxins. When you get hit in the course of a fight, your Health pool is diminished. A higher Health pool allows you to stay in a fight longer before succumbing to your injuries.

When your Health pool is depleted, you may be dazed, wounded, or pushing up the daisies.
##### Hope

Jarring or stressful events can exert a damaging long- psychological toll. Your Hope rating indicates how far you are from total despair.

A character can only burn their Hope points by helping another character's roll. You may lose Hope points by having stressful experiences.

You get Hope 1 for free.

##### Despair

As a counterpoint to the Hope rating, a character's Despair rating indicates their susceptibility to mental trauma and negative emotional states. As a character experiences traumatic events, their Despair rating may increase, making it more difficult for them to resist the negative effects of further emotional or psychological stress.

A character can only burn their Despair points by sabotaging another character's roll.

You get Despair 1 for free.


##### Hypnosis

This ability represents medical hypnosis as depicted in pulpy genre sources; it is not psychic mesmerism or Dr Caligari-style mind control. You can only hypnotize a _willing_ subject, and only one subject at a time. Using Hypnosis requires a Test against a Difficulty Number that varies depending on what you are using it for.

• _Simple hypnotic state:_ To place a patient in a hypnotic trance, you must succeed against Difficulty 3. During this trance, she is calm and placid.

• _Establish analytic rapport:_ Once you have successfully hypnotized a patient, your Psychoanalysis pool increases by 3 during any future use of Psychoanalysis on them. Your Psychoanalysis rating must be at least 3 to gain this benefit, and the 3 points must be spent on the patient.

• _Recover memories:_ The patient’s fragmented or buried memories, as of dreams, traumas, or murky monster attacks, can be called to the surface and “relived.” This is a Difficulty 4 test. Reliving an experience that cost Stability will cost the patient the same amount again, although you may practice immediate Psychological Triage to minimize the patient’s shock. The GM is free to provide false memories if she feels you are “leading the witness.”

• _Post-hypnotic suggestion:_ Upon lifting the trance, you may cause your patient to perform a single action without apparent thought. You may require a “trigger phrase” or simply specify a time: (“When you get home, you’ll leave the book on the desk.”) Spells and other complex activities cannot be post-hypnotically induced. The patient will not accept a suggestion contrary to her normal behavior. This is a Difficulty 4 or higher test; the GM may increase the Difficulty based on the suggestion.

• _Ease pain:_ You can relieve symptomatic pain in a patient. This removes the mechanical penalties for being hurt and lasts until the patient is wounded again. This is a Difficulty 4 or higher test; the GM may increase the Difficulty depending on the pain’s severity. _This does not work under battlefield conditions._

• _False memories:_ You can purposely implant false memories in the patient or bury real ones. This is extremely unethical without a direct therapeutic benefit (such as easing a remembered trauma). This is a Contest between your Hypnosis and the patient’s Stability. Your Difficulty Number is 5; the patient resists with Difficulty 4. Again, the GM may increase your Difficulty based on the severity of the memory change. At the GM’s discretion, if the patient suffers a further trauma (such as her Stability dropping below -5 again), she may suddenly recall the truth.

##### Infiltration

You’re good at placing yourself inside places you have no right to be. You can:

-   pick locks
-   deactivate or evade security systems
-   move silently
-   find suitable places for forced entry, and use them

Despite its name, Infiltration is as useful for getting out of places undetected as if its for getting into them.

##### Mechanics

You’re good at building, repairing, and disabling devices, from classic pit-and-pendulum traps to DVD players. Given the right components, you can create jury-rigged devices from odd bits of scrap. Mechanics doubles as an investigative ability when used to:

-   evaluate the quality of workmanship used to create an item
-   determine the identity of a handmade item’s maker by comparing to known work by that individual

##### Medic

You can perform first aid on sick or injured individuals. For more on the use of this ability, see “Exhaustion, Injury, and Death.”

If you have 8 or more points in Medic, you get 1 point in Pathology.

##### Scuffling

You can hold your own in a hand-to-hand fight, whether you wish to kill, knock out, restrain, or evade your opponent.

##### Sense Trouble

Keen perceptions allow you to spot signs of potential danger to yourself and others. Information gained from this ability might save your skins but doesn’t directly advance the central mystery. You might use it to:

-   hear someone sneak up on you
-   see an obscured or hidden figure
-   smell a gas leak
-   have a bad feeling about this

Players never know the Difficulty Numbers for Sense Trouble before deciding how many points to spend, even in games where GMs generously inform the players of other Difficulty Numbers. Players must blindly choose how much to spend.

When more than one player is able to make a Sense Trouble test, the group decides which of them makes the attempt. Only one attempt per source of trouble occurs, conducted by the chosen PC.

##### Specific Weapon Use

You are adept with firearms, katanas or darts.

##### Unobtrusiveness

You’re good at noticing other people trying to be unobtrusive, just as you’re skilled at hiding and avoiding notice. It’s up to you whether you use skill, technology, minor psychic prowess, or a combination of those to blend into the background. With a successful Unobtrusiveness test, you can:

-   spot someone trying to hide or be sneaky
-   avoid being surprised in combat
-   surprise others in combat
-   follow someone without being noticed
-   hide in plain sight within a crowd
-   blend into the shadows to hide
-   escape from someone following you
-   pass unnoticed despite being the sort of person who would normally attract attention



#### Point Pool

Lets follow the following scenario: At the beginning of a game, there are 16 characters with 65 points each, for a total of 1040 points (16 x 65 = 1040). As each character dies, their 65 points are redistributed among the remaining characters.

For example, when the 16th character dies, their 65 points are redistributed among the remaining 15 characters. Each character would receive an additional 65/15 = 4.33 points, in this case 4 points as we will always be rounding the numbers to the smallest possible number.

This process continues as more characters die, with the points being redistributed equally among the remaining characters. Therefore, the function that describes the redistribution of points as characters die is:

_Points distributed = (Total points - (65 x Number of deaths)) / Number of survivors_

Where:

Total points = 1040 (the starting total number of points)
Number of deaths = the number of characters who have died
Number of survivors = the current number of characters remaining in the game

For a game with 16 characters (ideal party size) we would have the following distribution.

N of Character Alive|N of deaths   | N of Points Distributed
16|0 deaths   |0
15|1 deaths   |4
14|2 deaths   |4
13|3 deaths   |5
12|4 deaths   |5
11|5 deaths   |5
10|6 deaths   |6
09|7 deaths   |7
08|8 deaths   |8
07|9 deaths   |9
06|10 deaths  |10
05|11 deaths  |13
04|12 deaths  |16
03|13 deaths  |21
02|14 deaths  |End Game

14. The headmaster alone has the authority to modify the rules as necessary.

## Footnotes

[^1]: The amount of information you recall about a topic is directly proportional to how much it relates to your character background for balancing reasons. An Ultimate Art Student might have an encyclopedic knowledge of Art History, not that much knowledge of Calculus, and a fair knowledge of geometry.
[^2]: Stalking takes an action during a block of time, therefore you will not be able to stalk more than a character during it.
