## Abilities

### Investigative Abilities
#### Bayesian Probability

Bayesian probability is a statistical method that allows one to update their beliefs about an event based on new evidence. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with the ability to use Bayesian probability would be able to make more informed and accurate judgments about the likelihood of certain events or hypotheses based on the available evidence.

For example, such a character could weigh the strength of each piece of evidence in a murder investigation, assign probabilities to each hypothesis, and update those probabilities as new evidence is discovered.

#### Mathematical Logic

Mathematical logic is the study of mathematical reasoning and the rules of logical inference. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with the ability to use mathematical logic would be able to analyze and interpret complex patterns of evidence to make more informed and accurate deductions.

For example, such a character could use mathematical reasoning to identify patterns in numerical data. They could also use their knowledge of logical systems to break codes or decipher complex puzzles, providing a valuable asset to the player in solving the mystery. 

#### Encyclopedic Knowledge

Encyclopedic Knowledge is the ability to retain and recall a vast amount of information on a wide range of subjects [^1]. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with Encyclopedic Knowledge would be able to draw on their vast store of knowledge to make connections between seemingly unrelated pieces of evidence or to identify obscure references in witness testimony.

For example, such a character might be able to identify a rare type of poison used in a murder, recognize a particular weapon as being of historical significance, or recall a little-known fact about a suspect's background. This ability could also be useful for decoding cryptic messages or solving complex puzzles, as the character would have a wealth of knowledge to draw upon.

#### Elocutio

Elocutio, also known as the art of speaking or rhetoric, is the ability to effectively communicate ideas and persuade others through language. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with Elocutio would be able to use their mastery of language to gather information from witnesses, negotiate with suspects, and convince others to see things from their perspective.

For example, such a character might be able to use their charm and charisma to convince a witness to divulge information they might otherwise withhold, or to persuade a reluctant suspect to confess.

#### Mood Analysis

Mood Analysis is the ability to analyze a character for signs of despair and hope in a character, which could provide clues about the motivations or future actions of the analyzed character. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with the ability to use Mood Analysis would be able to read the emotional state of suspects after an interaction.

The characters with such skills will have another sheet from where they can keep track of other characters state of despair and hope. In a setting where emotions are the central theme, the ability to use Mood Analysis could be a valuable asset to the player, as it could provide insight into the complex psychological landscape of the game's characters.

#### Detecting Lies

Detecting Lies is the ability to accurately determine when someone is lying, based on subtle cues in their body language, tone of voice, or word choice. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with the ability to use Detecting Lies would be able to identify inconsistencies or discrepancies in the statements of suspects and witnesses.

For example, such a character might be able to detect when a suspect is evading a question or trying to hide something, or notice when a witness is struggling to maintain a consistent story. They might also be able to use their understanding of human psychology to manipulate conversations in a way that elicits more honest responses from those they are interrogating.

#### Photographic Memory

Photographic Memory is the ability to vividly recall information from one's memory, often including details such as images, sounds, and text. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with Photographic Memory would be able to recall precise details about crime scenes, evidence, and witness testimony, often long after they were initially observed.

For example, such a character might be able to recall the specific details of a crime scene, such as the exact position of objects or the positioning of a body, or the specific wording of a witness's testimony. They might also be able to recall information that others might overlook or forget, such as minor details or seemingly unimportant pieces of evidence.

#### Play the Actor

Play the Actor is the ability to convincingly lie and deceive others through acting and improvisation. **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with Play the Actor would be able to convincingly deceive others, making it difficult for other characters to detect their lies or uncover the truth.

For example, such a character might be able to convincingly pretend to be someone else, manipulate others through their body language and tone of voice, or use their acting skills to fabricate elaborate stories or alibis. They might also be able to read the emotions and reactions of others, allowing them to adjust their performance in real-time and further deceive those around them.

#### Reconstructive Imagination

Reconstructive Imagination is the ability to use imagination and intuition to fill in missing pieces of information and recreate past events in one's mind. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with Reconstructive Imagination would be able to use their creativity and perceptiveness to visualize events that they did not witness firsthand, providing valuable insight into mysteries and investigations.

For example, such a character might be able to use their Reconstructive Imagination to piece together events of a crime based on available evidence, such as the trajectory of a bullet based on where a body was found. They might also be able to use their imagination to generate new theories and hypotheses, leading the player to new discoveries and deeper understanding of the events around them.

#### Hyper-Focus

Hyper-Focus is the ability to concentrate intensely on a single task or subject, often to the point of excluding distractions and ignoring other important information. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with Hyper-Focus would be able to zero in on specific details and clues, allowing them to gain a deeper understanding of the mysteries they are exploring.

For example, such a character might be able to use their Hyper-Focus to identify what kind of venom was used by a crucial analysis realized in a laboratory. They might also be able to use their intense concentration to solve complex puzzles or break codes, providing valuable assistance to the player in their quest to uncover the truth.

#### Absolute Gut-Feeling

Absolute Gut-Feeling is the ability to sense or intuitively know the correct answer or course of action, even without a clear or logical explanation. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with Absolute Gut-Feeling would be able to make seemingly impossible connections and deductions, drawing on their intuition and instincts to guide them to the truth.

For example, such a character might have a sudden insight or epiphany that helps them solve a complex puzzle or solve a crutial mistery in a murder investigation. They are also able to pick up on someone's vibes. This ability could be particularly useful in high-pressure situations where time is of the essence, as the character would be able to make quick decisions and take decisive action based on their intuition.

#### Forensic Analysis

Forensic Analysis is the application of scientific methods and techniques to the investigation of crimes and other legal issues. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with the ability to perform Forensic Analysis would be able to use their knowledge of scientific principles and procedures to analyze physical evidence and reconstruct the events surrounding a crime.

For example, such a character might be able to analyze blood spatter patterns to determine the position and movement of the victim and the perpetrator at the time of the crime. They might also be able to use chemical tests to identify the presence of a particular substance at a crime scene, such as poison or explosive residue. Additionally, they might be able to analyze digital evidence, such as security camera footage or cell phone records, to piece together a timeline of events and identify suspects.

#### Stalking Skills

Stalking Skills refer to the ability to observe and monitor a person, often with the goal of gathering information. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with strong Surveillance Skills would be able to gather information by observing the character being stalked, monitoring their movements and interactions, and identifying patterns of behavior.

For example, such a character might be able to follow a suspect without being noticed, use a hidden camera to record a conversation, or steal something the character owns without being detected. It is important to reinforce that you will only be able to stalk a single person for each point in spent in Stalking Skills[^2].

#### Contextualization

Contextualization is the ability to interpret information and evidence within its larger social, cultural, and historical context. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with strong contextualization skills would be able to identify and interpret the underlying social and cultural factors that may have contributed to the crime, as well as recognize how the crime fits within a larger historical narrative.

For example, such a character might be able to identify how certain cultural or historical events may have influenced a suspect's motivations or actions, or how societal pressures or norms may have played a role in shaping witness testimony or evidence. They may also be able to recognize patterns in the crime that reflect broader social or cultural trends or issues, providing valuable insight into the underlying causes of the crime.

#### Metacognition

Metacognition is the ability to reflect on one's own thinking processes and to consciously regulate and direct one's own learning and problem-solving strategies. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with strong metacognitive skills would be able to analyze and improve their own thinking and problem-solving abilities, enabling them to become more effective investigators and problem-solvers.

For example, such a character might be able to reflect on their own thinking processes and identify areas where they tend to make errors or overlook important information. They might then be able to develop strategies to overcome these limitations, such as taking more time to carefully review evidence or using visual aids to help them better organize information. They might also be able to recognize when they are becoming stuck or frustrated and use strategies to refocus their thinking or regulate their emotions, allowing them to more effectively approach the problem at hand.



### Emotional Abilities
#### Charm

Charm is the ability to interact with others in a likable, appealing, and engaging way. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with strong charm skills would be able to use their personal magnetism to win over others, making them more willing to cooperate, divulge information, or even become allies.

For example, such a character might use their charm to persuade a reluctant witness to cooperate or to disarm a suspicious suspect. They might also use their charm to build alliances with other characters, cultivating relationships that could prove useful in their time in the game.

#### Intimidation

Intimidation is the ability to instill fear or apprehension in others through forceful and threatening behavior. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with strong intimidation skills would be able to use their intimidating presence and actions to elicit information or coerce cooperation from others.

For example, such a character might use their physical size, imposing demeanor, or verbal threats to intimidate another character. They might also use their reputation for ruthlessness to manipulate others or gain a tactical advantage in confrontations.

#### Reassurance

Reassurance is the ability to comfort and encourage others, providing emotional support and easing their anxieties or fears. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with strong reassurance skills would be able to build relationships with other characters and gain their trust, making it more likely that they will cooperate and provide valuable information.

For example, such a character might be able to calm a distressed witness or a traumatized survivor, reassuring them that they are safe and that their help is crucial to solving the case. They might also use their ability to provide emotional support to forge alliances with other characters, building a network of relationships that can help them to navigate the complex social dynamics of the game.

#### Courage

Courage is the ability to confront fear, danger, or uncertainty and to take action in spite of the potential risks or consequences. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with high levels of courage would be able to face dangerous situations head-on and to make difficult decisions even in the face of uncertainty or ambiguity.

For example, such a character might be willing to take risks that others would consider too dangerous or to confront suspects who might be hostile or violent against their own reptile brain. They might also be able to remain focused and determined in the face of adversity or setback, inspiring others to keep going and to stay motivated.

#### Self-Control

Self control is the ability to regulate one's thoughts, emotions, and behaviors in order to achieve long-term goals or to maintain composure in stressful or challenging situations. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with high levels of self control would be able to maintain a clear and focused mind even in the midst of chaos or danger, enabling them to make rational and effective decisions.

For example, such a character might be able to resist the temptation to act impulsively or to give in to fear or anxiety, instead focusing on the task at hand and making strategic plans to achieve their objectives. They might also be able to remain calm and composed in the face of stressful or emotionally charged situations, enabling them to maintain a clear and objective perspective on the investigation.

#### Morale

Morale is a measure of a character's mental and emotional resilience in the face of adversity. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character's morale may be affected by a variety of factors, such as the difficulty of the challenges they face, the level of danger and uncertainty in their environment, and the quality of their relationships with other characters.

A character with high morale may be able to maintain a positive outlook and a sense of determination even in the face of overwhelming odds, enabling them to push through challenges and achieve their objectives. They may be able to inspire others with their optimism and energy, helping to boost the morale of the group as a whole.

#### Despair Absorption

Despair absorption is a unique ability that allows a character to absorb de Despair of another character. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with the ability to absorb Despair will be known by the group as a source of hope.

However, absorbing Despair might make your character ovewhelmed by the negative emotions they are absorbing, potentially leading to a beakdown or loss of control. You might also accidentally help someone you should have not helped and end up giving potential advantage to an enemy.

#### Despair Projection

Despair absorption is a unique ability that allows a character to manifest Despair on another character. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with the ability to project Despair will be known by the group as a source of Despair.

However, projecting Despair might make your character be viewed by the negative emotions they are projecting, potentially leading to a bad image overall.

#### Authority

Authority is the ability to project a sense of confidence, leadership, and control in a given situation. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with authority could have a significant impact on the actions and decisions of other characters in the game.

For example, if the group was faced with a difficult decision or a dangerous situation, the character with authority could use their presence and charisma to inspire confidence and rally the group together. Additionally, if the group was split on a particular course of action, the character with authority could use their persuasive skills to convince others to follow their lead.

This ability could also be useful in navigating social situations or negotiations with other characters. By projecting an air of confidence and control, the character with authority could potentially gain an advantage in convincing others to see things from their perspective or to agree to their terms[^3].



### Cohabitational Abilities
#### Synergy

Jack of all trades is the ability to be competent in a wide range of skills and knowledge, without necessarily having a particular expertise in any one area. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with this ability would be able to adapt to a variety of situations and challenges, and have a general understanding of a broad range of subjects.

#### Collaboration

Collaboration is the ability to work effectively with others towards a shared goal. In **ADD RPG NAME**, a character with this ability would be able to contribute to group tasks and investigations by building strong working relationships with other characters, communicating effectively, and using their unique strengths to complement those of their allies.

### General Abilities

#### Athletics

Athletics allows you to perform general acts of physical derring-do, from running to jumping to dodging falling or oncoming objects. Any physical action not covered by another ability, probably falls under the rubric of Athletics.

If your Athletics rating is 8 or more, your Hit Threshold, the Target Number your opponents use when attempting to hit you in combat, is 4. Otherwise, your Hit Threshold is 3.

#### Burglary

You’re good at placing yourself inside places you have no right to be, and you’re good at taking things once you’re there. With a successful Burglary test, you can:

-   pick pockets
-   unobtrusively search a target’s pockets
-   plant objects on unsuspecting subjects
-   pick locks
-   deactivate or evade security systems (although particularly high-tech security systems might require you to have a point in the Investigative ability Hacking)
-   find suitable places for forced entry, and use them

Many locks require specialized tools that can be produced with a Preparedness test; such tools range from simple lock picks to sonic high-tech multi-tools. Complex or tricky locks may have a higher than usual Difficulty to open them speedily, to avoid noise or damage, or to relock afterward.

#### Business Affairs

You know how to run a profitable business, group, organization, cult, secret society and etc.

#### Conceal

You can hide things from view and conceal them from search. Your methods might include camouflage, holding items out on your person, snaking things into drawers unobserved, building secret compartments, or even altering a thing’s visual signature with paint or plaster.

This ability also allows you to discover things intentionally concealed.

#### Disguise

This is the skill of altering your own appearance, posture, and voice to be unrecognizable. Disguising others in anything more complex than a baseball cap or false mustache is good only for brief periods, as posture and body language are vital components in any successful disguise.

This ability also covers selling yourself as a different person: vocal mannerisms, altered body language, dress and motion sense, and realistic-seeming reactions.

Successfully disguising yourself as an actual person already known to those you’re interacting with is extraordinarily difficult. Brief voice-only mimicry pits you against a Difficulty of 4. Face-to-face impersonation requires a successful roll against a Difficulty of 7 for every five minutes of sustained contact between you and the object of your impersonation.

#### Explosives

You’re an expert in bombs and booby-traps. You can:

-   defuse bombs and traps
-   handle nitroglycerine or other dangerously unstable materials with relative safety
-   given time, blow open safes or vaults without damaging the contents
-   mix explosive compounds from common chemicals
-   safely construct and detonate explosive devices or booby-traps of your own

Explosives doubles as an investigative ability when used to:

-   reconstruct exploded bombs
-   for any bomb (exploded or unexploded), determine the method and materials of the bomb-maker, and deduce his sophistication, background, and skill

#### Filch

Your nimble fingers allow you to unobtrusively manipulate small objects. You can:

-   pilfer clues from a crime scene under the very noses of unsuspecting authorities
-   pick pockets
-   plant objects on unsuspecting subjects

#### Fleeing

Although you are not a strong overall athlete, you can boot it like a bat out of hell when chased by dangerous people, beings, or moving objects.

If your Fleeing rating is more than twice your final Athletics rating, you can buy rating points in Fleeing above the value at a reduced rate, getting 2 rating points for each build point spent. Hence, if your Athletics rating is 0, all your Fleeing is half-price.

#### Gambling

You are conversant with the rules and etiquette of all forms of gambling, from Texas hold ‘em and roulette to horse racing and numbers rackets. To win (or strategically lose) at a game of chance or sporting flutter requires a Gambling test, or a contest if played against an NPC with the Gambling ability. In addition to playing by the rules and winning, you can:

-   spot cheating, either by the house or by another player
-   stack a deck, rig a horse race, load dice, or otherwise cheat

Palming cards, tiles, or dice is allowed as a Gambling test; anything else requires Conceal or Filch.

Gambling doubles as an **Investigative** ability when used to:

-   calculate the odds of events ruled by probabilities
-   use Bullshit Detector on professional gamblers despite their poker faces
-   interact with gamblers and blend in at casinos

#### Health

Health measures your ability to sustain injuries, resist infection, and survive the effects of toxins. When you get hit in the course of a fight, your Health pool is diminished. A higher Health pool allows you to stay in a fight longer before succumbing to your injuries.

When your Health pool is depleted, you may be dazed, wounded, or pushing up the daisies.

#### Hypnosis

This ability represents medical hypnosis as depicted in pulpy genre sources; it is not psychic mesmerism or Dr Caligari-style mind control. You can only hypnotize a _willing_ subject, and only one subject at a time. Using Hypnosis requires a Test against a Difficulty Number that varies depending on what you are using it for.

• _Simple hypnotic state:_ To place a patient in a hypnotic trance, you must succeed against Difficulty 3. During this trance, she is calm and placid.

• _Establish analytic rapport:_ Once you have successfully hypnotized a patient, your Psychoanalysis pool increases by 3 during any future use of Psychoanalysis on them. Your Psychoanalysis rating must be at least 3 to gain this benefit, and the 3 points must be spent on the patient.

• _Recover memories:_ The patient’s fragmented or buried memories, as of dreams, traumas, or murky monster attacks, can be called to the surface and “relived.” This is a Difficulty 4 test. Reliving an experience that cost Stability will cost the patient the same amount again, although you may practice immediate Psychological Triage to minimize the patient’s shock. The GM is free to provide false memories if she feels you are “leading the witness.”

• _Post-hypnotic suggestion:_ Upon lifting the trance, you may cause your patient to perform a single action without apparent thought. You may require a “trigger phrase” or simply specify a time: (“When you get home, you’ll leave the book on the desk.”) Spells and other complex activities cannot be post-hypnotically induced. The patient will not accept a suggestion contrary to her normal behavior. This is a Difficulty 4 or higher test; the GM may increase the Difficulty based on the suggestion.

• _Ease pain:_ You can relieve symptomatic pain in a patient. This removes the mechanical penalties for being hurt and lasts until the patient is wounded again. This is a Difficulty 4 or higher test; the GM may increase the Difficulty depending on the pain’s severity. _This does not work under battlefield conditions._

• _False memories:_ You can purposely implant false memories in the patient or bury real ones. This is extremely unethical without a direct therapeutic benefit (such as easing a remembered trauma). This is a Contest between your Hypnosis and the patient’s Stability. Your Difficulty Number is 5; the patient resists with Difficulty 4. Again, the GM may increase your Difficulty based on the severity of the memory change. At the GM’s discretion, if the patient suffers a further trauma (such as her Stability dropping below -5 again), she may suddenly recall the truth.

#### Infiltration

You’re good at placing yourself inside places you have no right to be. You can:

-   pick locks
-   deactivate or evade security systems
-   move silently
-   find suitable places for forced entry, and use them

Despite its name, Infiltration is as useful for getting out of places undetected as if its for getting into them.

#### Mechanics

You’re good at building, repairing, and disabling devices, from classic pit-and-pendulum traps to DVD players. Given the right components, you can create jury-rigged devices from odd bits of scrap. Mechanics doubles as an investigative ability when used to:

-   evaluate the quality of workmanship used to create an item
-   determine the identity of a handmade item’s maker by comparing to known work by that individual

#### Medic

You can perform first aid on sick or injured individuals. For more on the use of this ability, see “Exhaustion, Injury, and Death.”

If you have 8 or more points in Medic, you get 1 point in Pathology.

#### Scuffling

You can hold your own in a hand-to-hand fight, whether you wish to kill, knock out, restrain, or evade your opponent.

#### Sense Trouble

Keen perceptions allow you to spot signs of potential danger to yourself and others. Information gained from this ability might save your skins but doesn’t directly advance the central mystery. You might use it to:

-   hear someone sneak up on you
-   see an obscured or hidden figure
-   smell a gas leak
-   have a bad feeling about this

Players never know the Difficulty Numbers for Sense Trouble before deciding how many points to spend, even in games where GMs generously inform the players of other Difficulty Numbers. Players must blindly choose how much to spend.

When more than one player is able to make a Sense Trouble test, the group decides which of them makes the attempt. Only one attempt per source of trouble occurs, conducted by the chosen PC.

#### Shrink

You can provide comfort, perspective and solace to the mentally troubled. You may be a therapist or counselor, a priest or pastor, or just a empathetic and intuitive individual. You can restore panicked characters to a state of calm, and treat any long-term mental illnesses they accrue in the course of their investigations.

#### Specific Weapon Use

You are adept with firearms, katanas or darts.

#### Hope

Jarring or stressful events can exert a damaging long- psychological toll. Your Stability rating indicates your resistance to mental trauma.

You get Stability 1 for free.

#### Unobtrusiveness

You’re good at noticing other people trying to be unobtrusive, just as you’re skilled at hiding and avoiding notice. It’s up to you whether you use skill, technology, minor psychic prowess, or a combination of those to blend into the background. With a successful Unobtrusiveness test, you can:

-   spot someone trying to hide or be sneaky
-   avoid being surprised in combat
-   surprise others in combat
-   follow someone without being noticed
-   hide in plain sight within a crowd
-   blend into the shadows to hide
-   escape from someone following you
-   pass unnoticed despite being the sort of person who would normally attract attention


### Footnotes

[^1]: The amount of information you recall about a topic is directly proportional to how much it relates to your character background for balancing reasons. An Ultimate Art Student might have an encyclopedic knowledge of Art History, not that much knowledge of Calculus, and a fair knowledge of geometry.
[^2]: Stalking takes an action during a block of time, therefore you will not be able to stalk more than a character during it. Still, you will be able to interchangeably choose the character you will be stalking from the list of characters you have chosen to stalk. You can also freely change the character you are stalking. The only way to be discovered as a stalker is by being stalked by another stalker.
[^3]:Generally, characters with the highest points in authority become leaders of their groups. Characters with high authority levels hardly become friendly towards other characters with high authority levels.
[^4]:To be more exact: a character receives +0.25x bond points for each point they have in this skill.

## Ultimate High School _N_ 

Rather than Packages, in here we will stick to the good old Occupations, in this case, an specific talent for what your character is known for.
